#Additional Documentation
Any *.md file within the Additional folder will be automatically copied to the final doc folder. Be careful not to create documents here that have the same name as exported function names (well unless you really want the PlatyPS generated documentation to be overwritten every time you build the documentation).

##ReadTheDocs Manifest Creation
Each folder in this path becomes its own subsection within the ReadTheDocs YML manifest file. This only covers the base folder and all the *.md files within it (so no subfolders will be recognized). Each public function you have in this module will automatically be included in this manifest file and do not need to be specified (as they will be automatically generated by PlatyPS).
